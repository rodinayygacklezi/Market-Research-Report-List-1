<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PMMA Type Plastic Optical Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Step Index Profile</li><li>Graded Index Profile</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The PMMA Type Plastic Optical Fiber market consists of two primary profiles: Step Index Profile and Graded Index Profile. Step Index Profile fibers have a uniform refractive index in the core and a sharp transition to the cladding, which simplifies manufacturing and is effective for short-distance communication. In contrast, Graded Index Profile fibers feature a gradual change in refractive index, reducing modal dispersion and enhancing bandwidth over longer distances, making them ideal for high-speed data transmission. Both types cater to diverse application needs.</p></p>
