<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Transducers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>"Active"</li><li>"Passive"</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The digital transducers market can be divided into two main types: active and passive. Active transducers generate an output signal in response to an external stimulus, requiring an external power source for operation, such as temperature sensors and pressure transducers. In contrast, passive transducers do not produce signals on their own; instead, they modify an input signal from an external source, like resistive temperature devices or photoconductive cells. Both types play crucial roles in various applications, facilitating accurate data conversion and transmission.</p></p>
