<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Crude Oil Pipeline Infrastructure Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transmission</li><li>Gathering</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The crude oil pipeline infrastructure market consists primarily of two types: transmission and gathering. Transmission pipelines transport crude oil over long distances from production sites to refineries or storage terminals, often spanning across regions and requiring significant investment. Gathering pipelines, on the other hand, are shorter and transport crude oil from production wells to processing facilities or larger transmission lines. Both types are vital for efficient oil movement, ensuring a steady supply chain within the industry.</p></p>
