<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Brake Discs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Drum Type</li><li>Disc Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive brake discs market is primarily segmented into two types: drum type and disc type. Drum type brakes feature a cylindrical design where brake shoes press against the inner surface to slow down the vehicle, typically found in older or less performance-oriented vehicles. Disc type brakes, on the other hand, utilize a flat, rotational disc where brake pads clamp onto the disc for efficient stopping power, commonly used in modern vehicles for improved performance and heat dissipation.</p></p>
