<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self Expanding Metal Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fully</li><li>Partially</li><li>Uncovered</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The self-expanding metal stent market comprises three main types: fully covered, partially covered, and uncovered stents. Fully covered stents are completely lined with a biocompatible material, minimizing tissue ingrowth and enhancing durability. Partially covered stents feature selective lining, allowing for tissue integration while reducing migration risk. Uncovered stents have no lining and facilitate optimal anchoring and fluid flow but may lead to tissue growth, potentially causing blockage. Each type serves distinct therapeutic needs based on patient conditions.</p></p>
