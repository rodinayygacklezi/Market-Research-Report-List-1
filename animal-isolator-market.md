<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Animal Isolator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Pressure Isolator</li><li>Negative Pressure Isolator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Animal Isolator market is divided into two main types: Positive Pressure Isolators and Negative Pressure Isolators. Positive Pressure Isolators maintain an environment where air flows outward, preventing contaminants from entering, ideal for housing sensitive or immunocompromised animals. Conversely, Negative Pressure Isolators create an inward airflow to contain potential pathogens, protecting both the animals and the surrounding environment. These isolators are crucial in research and veterinary settings, ensuring animal health and safety while facilitating experimental control.</p></p>
