<p><strong>The Axial and Mixed Flow Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial Flow Pumps</li><li>Mixed Flow Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Axial and mixed flow pumps are two distinct types of hydraulic pumps used primarily for transporting fluids in various applications. Axial flow pumps move fluid parallel to the pump shaft, utilizing propeller-like impellers to achieve high flow rates with comparatively low pressure. Mixed flow pumps combine features of both axial and radial designs, enabling fluid movement at both parallel and perpendicular angles to the shaft, providing a balance of flow rate and pressure. Both types are used in industrial, agricultural, and municipal settings.</p></p>
