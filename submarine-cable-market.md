<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Submarine Cable Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Impregnated Paper Insulated Cable</li><li>Oil-filled Cable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The submarine cable market is primarily segmented into two types: impregnated paper insulated cables and oil-filled cables. Impregnated paper insulated cables utilize layers of specially treated paper to provide electrical insulation, ensuring reliability and durability under water. They are often preferred for their long lifespan and lower maintenance requirements. Oil-filled cables, on the other hand, use oil as an insulator and coolant, facilitating efficient heat dissipation and enhancing performance in deeper waters. Both types serve crucial roles in underwater communication and power transmission.</p></p>
