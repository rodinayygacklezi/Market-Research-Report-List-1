<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biogas Plant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Digestion</li><li>Dry Digestion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The biogas plant market comprises two primary digestion methods: wet and dry digestion. Wet digestion utilizes high moisture content feedstocks, such as agricultural waste and municipal sewage, allowing for efficient microbial activity in a liquid slurry. This method typically produces higher biogas yields. In contrast, dry digestion involves lower moisture content materials, like food waste or energy crops, processed in a solid form. This technique is often more space-efficient and suitable for specific types of organic waste, resulting in effective biogas production.</p></p>
